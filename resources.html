        Do you know what your FICO score is? Want to know the difference between your average bank and indirect
        finance firms? These are just some of the things that we'll run through to get you up to speed with finance.

        <div id = "Accounts"><span style = "font-size: 30px;">FICO Score</span><br>

          <div>
                <strong>What is it? </strong> Do you have a credit card? Have you owned one for over six months? Good! You now have FICO scores, which can help you save money. You have three credit scores: one for each of the major credit reporting agencies. Your overall FICO score can range anywhere from 300-850, where a higher score means that you have better credit. If you have a higher credit score, lenders are more likely to lend you money, which is really important come time you decide to make bigger investments.
                <br>
                <strong>How do you get a high credit score?</strong> Your FICO scores correlate to your financial behaviors in the past. If you do financially sound things, like paying off your bills on time or managing a large credit line, your credit score will go up, which then allows lenders to say "hey, I feel say lending money to this person, because they have been responsible with their credit in the past." A bad score, on the other hand, raises a lot of red flags for lenders. Your FICO scores are much like grades, in that they are reports that can be used to show your past performance.

        <div><span style = "font-size: 30px;">Direct VS Indirect Finance </span><br>
        <br>
          <div>
                <strong> The difference:</strong> The processes of lending and borrowing can either directly
                or indirectly. In direct finance, funds move directly from a lender to a borrower. Investors
                can provide direct financial options for borrowers. However, it can be costly, both in terms of money and time,
                because the borrowers and lenders have to match up. Matching up requires paperwork, lenders monitoring the
                credit strength of borrowers, and payments.
                Indirect finance is another form of finance.
                In indirect finance, funds are channeled indirectly
                through a third party or some intermediary . The most well-known form of financial intermediation is traditional banking. Typically, traditional banking takes place under one roof in commercial banks.
