Our project, codenamed Bamboo, is a viable, unique solution to a problem that currently affects around 16 million underbanked millenials in the U.S. The problem is that these individuals are unaware of the financial solutions available to them. Something we've observed is that there has been a growth in the market of nonbanked fintech companies and technologically-savvy investment firms, providing these people with options to establish credit, deal with loans, and make wise financial choices and investments for a better future. Bamboo is a marketplace where we connect clients with these companies by taking user data and providing recommendations for companies who can best suit their needs.
